#Two strings are considered almost equivalent if they are the same length and the count of their letter differs by no more than 3.
#IF you are given two arrays s and t, where s[i] and t[i] are a pair, see if these strings are almost equivalent

#Factors of 3 and 5 - An ideal number is a positive integer with only 3 and 5 as its prime divisors. 
#It can be expressed in the form of 3^x * 5^y (15, 45, and 75 are ideal numbers, but 6, 10, and 21 are not)
#Find the number of ideal integers within the given segment (low, high)
